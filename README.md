## Description:

Utilizing Node.js, this backend technology is meant to act as a CMS (Content Management Syster) for a supervisor to track their employees. With this, you can add employees by first and last name while assinging them a role by its ID. Similarily, you can create roles and departments by entering titles, inlcuding an id to track them by, and for roles specifically a salary. With this, it will be easy to keep track of employees and all the important information you need about them.
